// 003 Checking for equality

// You need to ask your computer these 3 questions:

// (1) Is one equal to one?
// (2) Is one equal to two?

// To have the computer answer if two things are the same, we can ask it 
// like this:

1 == 1;
1 == 2;

// You can also use three equal signs...

// ===

// ...but we'll leave that for another video
